you have to compile (you need to insatall g++ and powershell), becase compiling works differntly on different systems
if power shell does't work on your system this won't work

IN TERMINAL
    WINDOWS -> powershell.exe
    LINUX/MAC -> pwsh
THEN
    cd %path_to_folder%
    ./compile_program.ps1
    exit
